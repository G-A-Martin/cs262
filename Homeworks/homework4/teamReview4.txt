Gavin Martin Reviewing Team A: Time Tracker


Their user test was suprisingly well developed. They wrote a well documented script, planned it out well in a classroom, and were very proffessional. 
I will be honest, I had low expectatinos going in, but they had me test 10 minutes of features within their app. On the script they told me what features to 
test in what order. Some where hard to do, others were easy, but overall I felt that the user test they designed gave them good feedback. They even found a 
breaking bug that broke the app when you deleted a timer as it was running. Overall, I felt respected, and I felt like I was contributing. 

They have apparently pushed more code into their repo this week than they had all year. This was probably their most productive week as far as building the
app goes.
